# Celestial Universe - Link Structure Guide

## Root Level Files
- **Index.html** - Entry point (home page)

## Internal Links - From Index.html (Root)
```
./pages/Characters.html
./pages/News.html
./pages/Musics.html
./pages/Code.html
./pages/About.html
./pages/Contact.html
```

## Internal Links - From pages/*.html (One level deep)
```
../Index.html              (Back to home)
./Characters.html          (To other pages in same folder)
./News.html
./Musics.html
./Code.html
./About.html
./Contact.html
./characters/CelesteAiMaerah.html    (To character pages)
./characters/EmaxulateAmatAi.html
./characters/AetherEternael.html
```

## Internal Links - From pages/characters/*.html (Two levels deep)
```
../../Index.html                     (Back to home)
../Characters.html                   (To Characters list)
../News.html                         (To other main pages)
../Musics.html
../Code.html
../About.html
../Contact.html
```

## Asset References

### From Index.html (Root)
```
./assets/css/Styles.css
./assets/js/data.js
./assets/js/nav.js
```

### From pages/*.html (One level deep)
```
../assets/css/Styles.css
../assets/js/data.js
../assets/js/nav.js
```

### From pages/characters/*.html (Two levels deep)
```
../../assets/css/Styles.css
../../assets/js/data.js
../../assets/js/nav.js
```

## Navigation Links in data.js
The `data.js` file contains the navigation sections array that is used by `nav.js` to generate navigation menus dynamically:

```javascript
sections: [
  { id: 'home', name: 'Home', file: '../Index.html' },
  { id: 'characters', name: 'Characters', file: './Characters.html' },
  { id: 'news', name: 'News', file: './News.html' },
  { id: 'music', name: 'Music', file: './Musics.html' },
  { id: 'code', name: 'Studio', file: './Studio.html' },
  { id: 'about', name: 'About', file: './About.html' },
  { id: 'contact', name: 'Contact', file: './Contact.html' }
]
```

These paths are relative to the pages folder where they're primarily used.

## How It Works

1. **Brand Click Navigation**: The brand logo at the top uses intelligent path detection to navigate back to Index.html from any depth
2. **Auto-Generated Navigation**: The navigation bars are generated by `nav.js` reading from the `data.js` file
3. **Asset Loading**: All HTML files use relative paths appropriate for their depth in the folder structure
